section "${brl_tutorial}" "
Welcome to the ${Bedrock_Linux} basics tutorial.

This tutorial will introduce you to the minimum ${Bedrock_Linux}-specific
background required to utilize and manage a ${Bedrock} system.

$(standard_intro)
"

section "${Strata}" "
A ${Bedrock} system is composed of ${strata}, which are collections of
interrelated files and processes.  These typically correspond to Linux distro
installs: one may have a ${Debian} ${stratum}, an ${Arch} ${stratum}, etc.
${Bedrock} integrates these into a single, largely cohesive system.  Run

$(cmd "brl list")

to see a list of ${strata} currently being integrated together.

$(
	if [ "$(brl list | wc -l)" -le 2 ]; then
		printf "This appears to be a fresh Bedrock Linux install with two ${strata}:

- ${bedrock}, which is the ${stratum} providing ${Bedrock}-specific functionality.
- ${init_stratum} which currently provides everything else.

This isn't much more interesting than ${init_stratum} would have been by itself.
"
	else
		printf "This system appears to already have a number of ${strata}, including:

- ${bedrock}, which is the ${stratum} providing ${Bedrock}-specific functionality.
- ${init_stratum}, which is currently providing your init system.

amongst others.
"
	fi
)

The ${brl_fetch} command can be used to acquire new ${strata}.  To see distros
${brl_fetch} knows how to acquire, run

$(cmd "brl fetch --list")

Let's get a couple more ${strata} to experiment with in this tutorial:

$(rcmd "brl fetch -n tut-alpine alpine")
$(rcmd "brl fetch -n tut-void void")
" "brl list | grep \"^tut-alpine\$\" && brl list | grep \"^tut-void\$\""

section "Cross-${stratum} commands" "
Many features from the ${strata} we just acquired should work just as they
would in their normal environments.  For example, since we now have an
${Alpine} ${stratum}, we can run ${Alpine}'s ${apk} package manager directly on
the command line:

$(cmd "apk --help")

We also have a ${Void} ${stratum} providing ${xbps_install}:

$(cmd "xbps-install --help")

We can install ${Alpine}'s ${jq} and ${Void}'s ${jo}:

$(rcmd "apk add jq")
$(rcmd "xbps-install -y jo")

Importantly, the commands can interact just as they would were they from the
same distro:

$(cmd "jo \"distro=bedrock\" | jq \".distro\" | tee ${tmpfile}")
" "grep bedrock ${tmpfile}"

section "Other cross-${stratum} features" "
${Bedrock} integrates more than just terminal commands.  It strives to make as
much as it can work transparently and cohesively across ${strata}, including:

- Graphical application menu contents
- Shell tab completion
- Kernel firmware detection
- Xorg fonts
- Some themes

Lets try another example: ${man} pages.  We can get ${Alpine}'s ${jq} ${man}
page and ${Void}'s ${man} executable:

$(rcmd "apk add jq-doc")
$(rcmd "xbps-install -y man")

Then have ${Void}'s ${man} read ${Alpine}'s ${jq} documentation:

$(cmd "man jq | head | tee ${tmpfile}")
" "grep jq ${tmpfile}"

section "${brl_which}" "
On a ${Bedrock} system, every file and every process is associated with some
${stratum}.  The ${brl_which} command can be used to query ${Bedrock} for this
association.  Lets try it:

Which ${strata} provide the ${apk} and ${xbps_install} commands?

$(cmd "brl which apk")
$(cmd "brl which xbps-install")

What about commands that multiple ${strata} - ${bedrock}, ${tut_alpine}, ${tut_void},
$(
	if strat -r init /bedrock/libexec/busybox which ls >/dev/null 2>&1; then
		printf "${init_stratum}, "
	fi
)etc - all provide, such as ${ls}?

$(cmd "brl which ls")

Makes sense it has to pick a ${stratum} here, but why that one?  Keep this
question in mind, as it will be answered later in the tutorial.

Which ${strata} provide PID 1 (the init system) and PID $$ (this tutorial)?

$(cmd "brl which 1")
$(cmd "brl which $$")

Which stratum provides ${color_file}/${color_norm}, the root directory?

$(cmd "brl which /")

Again, sure it has to pick one, but why that specific ${stratum} for the root
directory that multiple ${strata} provide?  Like the ${ls} situation, this will
be answered soon enough.

Which ${stratum} provides ${bedrock_etc_bedrock_conf}, the ${Bedrock} configuration
file?

$(cmd "brl which /bedrock/etc/bedrock.conf")

Wait - that last command output ${global}, but ${color_alert}we do not have a such a ${stratum}:${color_norm}

$(cmd "brl list | grep global")

What's going on here?
"

section "File path types: ${local}" "
To avoid conflicts, processes from one ${stratum} may see their own
${stratum}'s instance of a given file (or lack of file) at a given file path.

This is why the ${stratum} providing your shell:

$(cmd "brl which")

Sees its own root directory instead of another ${stratum}'s:

$(cmd "brl which /")

If your shell ${stratum} has a ${color_file}/etc/os-release${color_norm}, it
will probably correspond to your shell ${stratum} distro:

$(cmd "cat /etc/os-release")

This is needed to avoid conflicts.  For example, ${Debian}'s ${apt} needs to
see ${Debian} mirrors at ${etc_apt_sources_list} and ${Ubuntu}'s ${apt} needs
to see ${Ubuntu}'s mirrors at the same path.  If they saw the same contents in
${sources_list} these two programs would conflict with each other.

In ${Bedrock} terminology, these file paths are described as ${local}.
"

section "File path types: ${global}" "
If all paths were ${local}, ${strata} would be unable to interact with each
other.  For ${strata} to interact, there are also ${global} paths: file paths
where every ${stratum} sees the same content.  Under-the-hood, these are
${bedrock} files which are being shared with other ${strata}.

For example, all ${strata} see the same contents in ${run} to communicate over
common sockets:

$(cmd "brl which /run")

Directories like ${home} and ${tmp} are also ${global}.  You can have software
from one ${stratum}, like ${Alpine}'s ${jq}, read files created by another
${stratum}, like ${Void}'s ${jo}, provided the file is in a ${global} location:

$(cmd "brl which /tmp")
$(cmd "jo \"path=global\" > ${tmpfile}")
$(cmd "jq \".path\" < ${tmpfile} | tee ${tmpfile2}")
" "grep global ${tmpfile2}"

section "File path types: ${cross}" "
Sometimes processes from one ${stratum} need to access ${local} files from
another.  This is achieved via ${cross} file paths.

If you want to read or write to a ${local} file specific to a given ${stratum},
prefix ${bedrock_strata}${color_sub}<stratum>${color_norm} to the file path to ${cross} to that
${stratum}:

$(cmd "brl which /bedrock/strata/bedrock/etc/os-release")
$(cmd "cat /bedrock/strata/bedrock/etc/os-release")
$(cmd "brl which /bedrock/strata/tut-alpine/etc/os-release")
$(cmd "cat /bedrock/strata/tut-alpine/etc/os-release")
"

section "${strat}" "
${bedrock_strata} is only suitable for reading and writing ${cross} files.  To
execute a program from a specific ${stratum}, prefix \`${strat} ${color_sub}<stratum>${color_norm}\`.
For example, if you care about which ${ls} you want to run:

$(cmd "strat tut-alpine ls --help 2>&1 | head -n1")
$(cmd "strat tut-void ls --help 2>&1 | head -n1 ")

If you do not specify the desired ${stratum} with ${strat}, ${Bedrock} will try
to figure one out from context:

- If ${Bedrock} is configured to ensure one ${stratum} always provides the
given command, it will do so.  For example, init related commands should always
correspond to the ${stratum} providing PID 1.  This is called ${pinning}.
- If the command is not ${pinned} to a given ${stratum} but is available
${locally}, ${Bedrock} will utilize the ${local} one.  This is to ensure
distro-specific dependency quirks are met.
- If the command is not ${pinned} and not available ${locally}, ${Bedrock}
assumes the specific build of the command does not matter.  In these cases
${Bedrock} will search other ${strata} and supply the first instance of the
command it finds.

The first bullet point above is why ${reboot} comes from the init stratum:

$(cmd "brl which reboot")
$(cmd "brl which 1")

The second bullet point above is why the ${ls} you get if you do not specify
one with ${strat}:

$(cmd "brl which ls")

is probably from the same ${stratum} providing your shell:

$(cmd "brl which")

and the third rule above is why ${apk} and ${xbps_install} work despite being
from different ${strata}:

$(cmd "brl which apk")
$(cmd "brl which xbps-install")
"

section "${restriction}" "
Occasionally, software may become confused by ${Bedrock}'s environment.  Most
notably this occurs when build tools scan the environment for dependencies and
find them from different distributions.  To handle this situation, ${strat}'s
$(flag -r) flag may be used to ${restrict} the command from seeing ${cross}-${stratum} hooks.

For example, normally ${tut_void}'s shell can see ${tut_alpine}'s ${apk}:

$(cmd "strat tut-void sh -c 'apk --help'")

But if you ${restrict} it, it cannot, and this command will fail:

$(cmd "strat -r tut-void sh -c 'apk --help'")

${Bedrock} will automatically ${restrict} some commands that it knows are
related to compiling, such as ${Arch}'s ${makepkg}.  If this is a problem for
any reason, you can un-${restrict} with ${strat} $(flag -u).

In general, if something acts oddly under ${Bedrock}, the first thing you
should try is to ${restrict} it.  This is especially true when it comes to
compiling software.
"

section "${stratum} states" "
It is sometimes useful to have a ${stratum}'s files on disk without them being
integrated into the rest of the system.  To do this, ${disable} the ${stratum}:

$(rcmd "brl disable tut-void")

This will stop all of the ${stratum}'s running processes and block the ability
to launch new ones.  This command will now fail:

$(cmd "strat tut-void xbps-install --help")

The ${stratum} may be re-enabled:

$(rcmd "brl enable tut-void")

after which this command will now work:

$(cmd "strat tut-void xbps-install --help")
"

section "Updating" "
Strata are each responsible for updating themselves.  To update ${tut_alpine}
we can tell its package manager to update:

$(rcmd "apk update && apk upgrade")

and to update ${tut_void} we can similarly instruct its package manager:

$(rcmd "xbps-install -Syu")

${bedrock} can be updated via ${brl}:

$(rcmd "brl update")
"

section "pmm" "
Manually updating all package managers as shown in the previous section may be a
bit tedious.  Other multi-package-manager workflows, such as searching multiple
package managers to see which provides a package, that can also be tedious to
do by hand.

To resolve this, Bedrock provides a utility called ${pmm} which abstracts
multi-package-manager and cross-package-manager workflows.

pmm mimics the user interface of other package managers.  Open
${bedrock_etc_bedrock_conf}
as root and find the user-interface field under the [pmm] section.  Populate it
according to the surrounding comments if it is empty then run

$(rcmd "brl apply")

to set ${pmm}s user interface.  Now explore

$(cmd "pmm --help")

or potentially

$(cmd "pmm-install --help")

depending on your configuration.
"

section "Removing ${strata}" "

As a protective measure, ${strata} may not be removed while ${enabled}.  If you
wish to remove a ${stratum}, first ${disable} it.

$(rcmd "brl disable tut-alpine")
$(rcmd "brl remove tut-alpine")

If you know the target ${stratum} is ${enabled}, ${brl_remove} takes a
${color_cmd}-d${color_norm} flag to ${disable} prior to removing:

$(rcmd "brl remove -d tut-void")
" "! brl list -v | grep -e \"^tut-alpine$\" -e \"^tut-void$\""

section "Special ${strata}" "
The ${stratum} currently providing PID 1 (the init) may not be ${disabled}, as the
Linux kernel does not respond well to PID 1 dying.  Given

$(cmd "brl which 1")

this command will fail:

$(rcmd "brl disable $(brl deref init)")

If you wish to remove the init-providing ${stratum}, first reboot and select
another ${stratum} to provide your init for the given session.

The ${bedrock} ${stratum} glues the entire system together.  It is the only
${stratum} which may not be removed.
$(
	if hijacked_stratum="$(brl deref hijacked 2>&1)"; then
		hijacked_stratum="${color_strat}${hijacked_stratum}${color_norm}"
		printf "
When ${Bedrock} ${hijacked} this computer, it:

- Moved the previous install files elsewhere.
- Installed itself to the root of the system.
- Added the previous install as a new ${stratum} called ${hijacked_stratum}.

Now that the ${hijack} operation has completed, there is nothing particularly
special about the ${hijacked_stratum} ${stratum}.  You are free to remove it,
should you wish to do so.  Just make sure to install anything essential that
${hijacked_stratum} is providing, such as the bootloader or kernel or ${sudo},
in another ${stratum}.
"
	fi
)
"

section "brl import" "
If you would like to make a ${stratum} from some distro that ${brl_fetch} does
not support, you may use the ${brl_import} command to do so.

Get the desired files in some format such as:

- directory containing desired files
- tarball containing desired files
- Virtual Machine image (e.g. .qcow, .vdi, .vmdk)

then run

$(rcmd "brl import <name> </path/to/source>")
"

section "${bedrock_conf}" "
All ${Bedrock} configuration is placed in a single file,
${bedrock_etc_bedrock_conf}.  If it seems like something ${Bedrock} does should
be configurable, look in there.  After making changes to ${bedrock_conf} run
${brl_apply} to ensure they take effect.

For example, run

$(cmd "brl --help")

$(
	if [ "$(cfg_value "miscellaneous" "color")" = "true" ]; then
		printf "and notice how pretty and colorful the output is.
Now open ${bedrock_etc_bedrock_conf} and find

	${color_file}color = true${color_norm}

towards the bottom and change it to

	${color_file}color = false${color_norm}

and apply that change:

$(rcmd "brl apply")

Now run

$(cmd "brl --help")

and notice how boring and monotone the output is.
"
	else
		printf "and notice how boring and monotone the output is.
Now open ${bedrock_etc_bedrock_conf} and find

	${color_file}color = [...]${color_norm}

towards the bottom and change it to

	${color_file}color = true${color_norm}

and apply that change:

$(rcmd "brl apply")

Now run

$(cmd "brl --help")

and notice how pretty and colorful the output is.
"
	fi
)

Finally, change the ${bedrock_conf} setting back and

$(rcmd "brl apply")

again to reset everything to how it was before.
"

section "${brl}" "
Most operations used to manage ${Bedrock} can be found in the ${brl} command.
This includes both those discussed earlier in the tutorial as well as some
which were skipped for brevity.

After this tutorial, consider exploring ${brl}:

$(cmd "brl --help")

going through other tutorials:

$(cmd "brl tutorial --help")

or reading through ${bedrock_etc_bedrock_conf}.
